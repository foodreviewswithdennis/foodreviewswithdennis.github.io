        <h3>Welcome to <a href="http://www.unionoysterhouse.com/" target="_blank">Union Oyster House</a></h3>
        <p>January 30th 2026</p>
        <p>First off, Union Oyster House was amazing! It had a great location, ambience and food. I got the Clam Chowder and the Fried Clams. The fried clams were AMAZING and since it was my first time trying them, it made me LOVE THEM. Their clam chowder was also perfect, living up to the Old Boston tradition. The building was SO COOL! It was a very old building with a great history. So if you are visiting Boston or you live around here I <b><i>totally recommend Union Oyster House!</i></b><br></p>

        <h3>Why I liked <a href="https://www.lastomasas.com/en" target="_blank">Restaurante Las Tomasas</a></h3>
        <p>January 23rd 2026</p>
        <p>First off, the views are AMAZING and the ambience is also very great. <a href="https://www.lastomasas.com/en" target="_blank">Las Tomasas</a> looks out at the Alhambra, one of Granada’s main attractions. Also, the food doesn’t disappoint. Their “Warm Starters” section and “Meats” section are very great. I only ordered from those sections, and I loved it very much. Granada is a great city with perfect hiking opportunities and as I previously mentioned, great food. Finally,  I thought as a great wrap-up to a great vacation in Granada, <a href="https://www.lastomasas.com/en" target="_blank">Las Tomasas</a> was perfect.</p>

        <h3>Why I liked Casa Robles</h3>
        <p>January 16th 2026</p>
        <p><a href="https://casarobles.es/en/our-menu/" target="_blank">Casa Robles</a> is a Andalusian restaurant in Seville, Spain that I LOVED and wanted to shout out! The ambience in Casa Robles is amazing, just off the main cathedral square in a small alleyway. Also, the food is world class. I loved everything in the Starter section like the “Homemade croquettes of the house”, the “Iberian acorn ham” and the “Assortment of the best andalucian cheeses with jam”. In Andalusian food, freshness, quality and tradition is something that really shows while eating at Casa Robles.</p>

        <h3>The History of Bolognese</h3>
        <p>December 12th 2025</p>
        <p>Bolognese is one of my favorite foods and I wanted to tell you about it. The exact origin is unclear but Bolognese was made in Bologna, Italy. During the Italian Renaissance, Bolognese became a true staple of Italian cuisine and it was enjoyed all over Italy. Bolognese is often served on tagliatelle pasta. Finally, after a long-time bolognese was enjoyed all over the world, from America to Argentina, you can find bolognese in many restaurants. <a href="https://www.accademiaitalianadellacucina.it/sites/default/files/Rag%C3%B9%20alla%20bolognese%20-%20updated%20recipe_20%20April%202023.pdf" target="_blank">Fun Fact: The Italian Academy of Cooking has made an official recipe for bolognese.</a></p>

        <h3>The History of Steak Frites</h3>
        <p>December 7th 2025</p>
        <p>Steak frites is one of my favorite foods and I wanted to learn about its history, 
            and I never knew about its long history in France and Belgium. It all goes back to the 
            Middle Ages where the French would serve steak with boiled and roasted potatoes. 
            While the French were perfecting steak, the Belgians were busy perfecting the art of 
            frying potatoes.  The concept of steak and frites emerged in the 19th century and rose in 
            popularity in France. And then good French steak paired with crispy Belgian frites 
            became very popular. When it became popular, then regional variations were made to 
            improve on the traditional steak frites. Finally, steak frites became a dish popular across 
            the whole world.</p>

        <h3>Steak Frites and Bolognese</h3>
        <p>November 25th 2025</p>
        <p>My favorite foods are Steak Frites and Bolognese. 
            Over this past summer I have been eating a lot of my
             favorite foods and going forward I will document the best
              Steak Frites and Bologneses that I eat.  One of my favorite 
              Steak Frites was at the Castle Hill Inn in Newport, RI. 
              One of my favorite Bologneses was from Siena in Mashpee, MA. 
              Both restaurants had very great versions of my favorite foods. </p>
